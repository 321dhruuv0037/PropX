# 🏠 PropX Property Exchange Portal

## 📘 Description

The **PropX Property Exchange Portal** is a decentralized application (DApp) that brings transparency, authenticity, and ease of use to the real estate ecosystem. Built on blockchain technology, it allows users to register, buy, and resell properties in a secure and tamper-proof environment. This project ensures that ownership records remain immutable and that transactions are trustless and verifiable.

### 🔑 Why this is needed?

- ❌ Traditional real estate transactions often involve fraud, forged documents, and disputes.
- ✅ Blockchain ensures secure, traceable, and transparent property management.
- ✅ Buyers can verify ownership history, view legal documents, and perform transactions seamlessly.
- ✅ Property resale and availability can be toggled easily by the owner, bringing control back to the users.
